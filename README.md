# Avidity paired-end scRNA-seq benchmark

### A comparison of 150bp x 150bp 3' scRNA-seq sequencing configuration on Illumina and Element sequencers 

This repository contains analysis code used by Chamberlin et al 2024. 

Site-level polyadenylation site quantifications from scraps and polyApipe are hosted in this repository.

Raw Illumina data are available on GEO; Element data are in the process of submission.
Please contact the authors if data are not yet available through GEO. 

Scraps installation is described at https://github.com/rnabioco/scraps
PolyApipe is available at https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/polyApipe


Our STAR and cutadapt parameters are available in the 'scripts' folder
